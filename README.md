# LinkedIn AI Message Generator

Hello  Guys

I have created the LinkedIn AI Message Generator chrome extension where, when user focuses on the message input field of a particular person, there appears the AI icon which popup the model to input the prompt and then generate the desired text message which you can directly insert it in to message section of the LinkedIn.


## Demo

## Features

- Show the AI icon when the user focuses on the LinkedIn message input field
- The icon disappear when the input field is no longer focused.
- Display a center-aligned modal when clicking on the icon
- Clicking anywhere outside the modal closes it.
- The user can enter any command in the modal's input field
- Clicking on the “Generate” button will only display this dummy response: (Thank you for the opportunity! If you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask).
* The “Regenerate” button is non-functional 
- When the user clicks on the insert button, the generated static text is inserted properly into the message input field 


## Roadmap
